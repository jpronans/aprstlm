For 1.3.x-pre:   (aka 1.3.0)

   o Add extra static code for PCSAT

   o PCSAT: Check +Z Temp
   o PCSAT: Check Bat A Current
   o PCSAT: Check Bat B Current
   o PCSAT: Check +Z Current
   o PCSAT: Check -Y Current	

   o MIM TODO:
      + BUG : Once EQNS Packet Received, display doesnt update until
              next TLM packet RXed.
      + BUG : Possible display corruption after EQNS change - May be
              fixable with the Positional Fix below.
      + BUG : Currently we look for in FROMCALL for the PARM,EQNS,BITS,
              and UNITs packets. We should be looking at the TOCALL. This
              won't be fixed until I actually implement a structure for
              the APRS packet, rather than the current string.
      + CODE: Positional Fix dependent length of on units, labels, eqns ?
      + CODE: Extra static handling plus "S" flag fix in extra_display

   o RAFT Support
      Add COMMAND_BITS strings and locations

      Move last 3 telemtry lines up ?

For 1.3.x-rrd, or maybe 1.4:

   o RRD Support
      + compile time support
      + run time enable (-rrd flag) vs seperate binary ?
         - daemonize
         - predict info still usefull ?
         - still need decode code
      + code support for:
         - rrd_create:
           if !exists for our satellite then
              create for our satellite
           fi
         - rrd_update:
           assume that we have already created the rrdtool at some point
